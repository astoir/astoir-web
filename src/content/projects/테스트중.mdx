Will become

It's also better than two spaces because it's visible.

Edit:
It doesn't work in some markdown applications, so it may cause incompatibility. [https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#line-break-best-practices](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#line-break-best-practices)

  I prefer this solution over the others because I have my IDE set to automatically trim extra whitespace at the end of a line. I don't want to turn that setting off just for this purpose, since it helps keep my code clean.

  Jep, trailing whitespace as semantic meaning is just the biggest antipattern in code or docs :)

  _intend_
   for there to be two spaces at the end. The problem is, there may not actually BE a space after the \\, in which case it fails. But better than two invisible spaces. So often I go with <br />. I agree with @mark—biggest antipattern ever. Right up there with semantic tabs in old makefiles.

  By the way, this is not recommended.
